        With Vivstock, you have the opportunity to invest your funds in a fixed deposit plan, offering a secure way to grow your investment. You can choose between two deposit terms: 6 months or 1 year, depending on your financial goals.
        <br /><br />
        6-Month Fixed Deposit: Opt for a 6-month term, and your funds will be locked in for the duration, earning you guaranteed interest. After 6 months, you can withdraw your principal along with the accumulated interest.
        <br /><br />
        1-Year Fixed Deposit: For those looking for longer-term growth, the 1-year fixed deposit option allows you to lock your funds for a full year. This term typically offers a higher return, rewarding your patience and commitment.
        <br /><br />
        At the end of your chosen term, you can easily withdraw both your initial deposit and the interest earned, or choose to reinvest your funds into another fixed deposit term. Vivstockâ€™s fixed deposit option ensures stability, predictable returns, and flexibility to match your investment preferences.
